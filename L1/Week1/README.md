# Personal Goals Document - Traders@SMU Alpha Program

*William Kroeger*

*Level 1 (Junior)*

## 1. Background in Quantitative Finance
<<<<<<< HEAD
*I have a relatively elementary background in Quantitative Finance. I have read a decent amount of books about systematic/algorithmic trading, options pricing, and coding, but I've never built my own strategies or completed my own backtesting. My dad was a "quant" which is how I began to get into the space, and I have always had a keen interest in mathematics as well as financial markets. I have a little experience at a family office doing very basic/intro trading work, like equity research and learning how markets work. I am working at the New York Stock Exchange this upcoming summer doing data analytics on their fixed income desk.

## 2. Career Goals
*In the short term, I aim to secure a quantitative research or trading internship at a hedge fund, proprietary trading firm, or investment bank. In the next five years, I hope to work as a full-time quantitative analyst or trader, specializing in algorithmic trading, risk management, or portfolio optimization. In the long term (10+ years), I aspire to take on a leadership role in the field, potentially leading a quantitative trading team or launching my own trading firm. My main areas of interest include high-frequency trading, statistical arbitrage, and machine learning applications in finance.*

## 3. What I Hope to Learn from This Program
*I hope to strengthen my technical skills in programming, particularly in Python and statistical modeling, to better analyze financial data. Additionally, I aim to deepen my understanding of financial markets, trading strategies, and risk management techniques. I am particularly interested in learning how to apply machine learning models to trading strategies and improving my ability to interpret market signals. Networking with industry professionals and peers is another key objective, as I want to gain insights from experienced traders and researchers. This program will serve as a stepping stone for me to bridge the gap between academic knowledge and practical application in trading.*

## 4. Current Technical Skills
*Java (basic), C++ (basic), Python (intermediate), R (basic), SQL (basic), Regression (intermediate), Time Series Analysis (beginner), Python libraries(pandas, numpy, polars, etc) (basic), Risk Metrics (intermediate)*

## 5. Development Plan & Program Goals
*During this program, I plan to develop my skills in quantitative trading strategy development, risk modeling, and market microstructure analysis. I will measure my progress through completed projects, backtested strategies, and improvements in my coding abilities. I plan to dedicate at least 10-15 hours per week to studying course materials, practicing coding, and working on trading models. Beyond the program, I will use books, research papers, and online resources to supplement my learning. Success for me in this program means being able to confidently design and implement a systematic trading strategy, understanding market behavior, and building a strong professional network within the quant finance industry.*
